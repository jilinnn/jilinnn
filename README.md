## Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Jilin Zheng.

I am currently a sophomore Computer Engineering student at Boston University. I am working as a part-time Researcher in the Laboratory of Networking and Information Systems (NISLAB) @ BU under Professor David Starobinski. My current project is investigating Kubernetes autoscaling in regards to Economic Denial-of-Service (EDoS) attacks.

I am looking for internships and co-ops for Summer 2024 and beyond! My interests lie in Backend Development, Embedded Systems, Cloud Computing, and AI/ML. Below are some of the projects I have worked on in the past. Have a look!
